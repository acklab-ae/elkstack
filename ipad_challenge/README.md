## The Challenge
Today, my youngest daughter asked me a question I thought was pretty interesting.  She asked me; if you didn't have any money and had one thing, what what it be?  I instantly responded back with "laptop".  When asked why, I said, I can make more money with a laptop than anything else.  In theory, this makes sense.  Especially with all these millionaire youtubers, instagram influencers, and content creators out there.  But that's easier said than done.  It's easy to say "I can make money", but when it comes down to execution, that's where issues arise and excuses are made.  

For the next 90 days, I will be only using my iPad and my goal is to generate passive income to survive as a single person.  In reality, I am married with 3 kids, have a steady income, and place to call home.  So for this challenge, I won't be utilizing any of the resources that I already have.  I will forgoe my weekly allowance for personal expenses and use only my iPad to "work".
